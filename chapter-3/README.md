# Group Project: Output Formatting

Do the project individually, share with group members, then create a combined, improved version based on each group member's original project. 
 
Write the source code for this program. Make it behave exactly like the attached sample exe

Have a project title (banner) with the appropriate information nicely centered on top

Use int for the hours worked and double for the pay rate

Nice well-formatted code and output screen.

Consider input error (enter int when double is expected and vice versa, input characters after the number is entered, etc). Your program should NOT crash when these situations randomly happen (or may not happen) in various runs of the program for some or all employees - and not the same employees in each run! (see screen shots). Test thoroughly and make sure it works in all of these situations and more! You are not responsible if a character is typed when a number is expected to begin with. We will fix that when we do input validation in chapter 5.

Remember money is ALWAYS displayed with two decimal places

Note: At the last line for pay rate it is the average (not the total)

Center and align the table like the sample exe (consider the use of named constants for easier updating of the field sizes
