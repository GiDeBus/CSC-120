## Group Project: Factorial

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

For example,

 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.

Note: 0! = 1.

[] - Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer number.

[] - Read the number.

[] - Check if it is a positive integer number. Keep asking the user for a positive integer number until the user gives you a positive integer number.

[] - Test for characters. Keep asking the user for valid input until the user gives you a positive integer number.

[] - Calculate the FACTORIAL of the given value as shown in the definition above.

[] - Display the output as shown on the screen.

NOTE: This program is on while loop. Do NOT use Do while or For loop.
Observe the good programming practices and the structure of a program.

Do not forget the comments, halt the screen, spacing of code and output, make it release etc.
