# IsPrimeNumber

## Directions

[] - Write a program that asks the user for whole integers.

[] - Read the input.

[] - Check if it is a positive integer number. keep on asking the user for a positive integer number till the user gives you a positive integer number. Make sure you catch the characters.

[] - Check if the variable is a prime number, display your answer with the corresponding validation.

[] - Tell the User to hit Enter to run the program again.

[] - Observe the good programming practices and the structure of a program.

[] - Do not forget the comments, halt the screen, spacing of code and output, make it release etc.

[] -For the title of the program use the "what you see is what you get approach" (only one cout statement in multiple lines).

Prime number: "A prime number is a positive integer `p > 1` that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and p itself. More concisely, a prime number p is a positive integer having exactly one positive divisor other than 1, meaning it is a number that cannot be factored".  [1]
