## Array Manipulation

# Directions

[x] - Create a function to perform the average of values in an array. To complete this portion, your code should match the following requirements:

[x] - Create a function called avg that will accept an integer array.

[x] - You may not have seen this in a demo but passing an array to a function is no different than passing any other data type.

[x] - Create an array of integers, at least 5 in size, and pass it to the avg function.

[x] - Inside the function, use a loop to iterate over the array elements and calculate the average.

[x] - Return the average back to the code that called it.
