## Lottery Winners

# Directions

A lottery ticket buyer purchases 10 tickets a week, always playing the same 10 5-digit “lucky” combinations. 

[x] - Write a program that initializes an array or a vector with these numbers and 
[] - then lets the player enter this week’s winning 5-digit number. 

[] - The program should perform a linear search through the list of the player’s numbers and report whether or not one of the tickets is a winner this week.


Here are the numbers:

13579, 26791, 26792, 33445, 55555,
62483, 77777, 79422, 85647, 93121

[] - Validate the input for the week's winning number. 
  [] - Ensure the input does not crash when entering a character or string value. 
  [] - Make sure to accept only positive numbers.


[] - Ask the user for the correct value each time they enter an incorrect one.
