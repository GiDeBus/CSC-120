Write a program that can be used as a math tutor for a young student. The program should display two random numbers to be subtracted, such as:

 10


[x] - The kind of question to be asked is random and the operands are also random (the operands will be between 1 and 99).

[x] - Prompt the user to solve the subtraction of two numbers.

[x] - The program should pause while the student works on the problem.
