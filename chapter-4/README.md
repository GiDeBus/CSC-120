[] - Display a menu.

[] - Prompt the user to enter the first operand (number).

[] - Prompt the user to enter the second operand (number).

[] - Prompt the user to select the operator from the menu.

Your program should be able to perform additions (+), subtractions (-), multiplications (*), divisions (real always) n (/), and find the remainder (%) (Do NOT use fmod - use the arithmetic operators ONLY for the actions). Give an informative error message if the user attempts to perform an action other than the known ones.

[] - Complete the following requirements below to get full credit.

[] - Have a project title (banner) with the appropriate information nicely centered on top

[] - Nice well-formatted source code

[] - Nice well-formatted output screen

[] - Make sure your code doesn't crash when characters are inputted after a double is given for an action to be performed and the prompts appear when they are supposed to

[] - Declare ONLY three numeric variables, two of them double and one integer

[] - Declare char to hold the operators

[] - You may declare other non-numeric variables.

[] - Prompt the user to enter the first operand (number)

[] - Prompt the user to enter the second operand (number)

[] - Both operands must NOT accept characters. Example +,;, r, etc

[] - Do NOT use/ introduce functions or methods to validate other than those we learned from chapters 1 - 4
Use the tools from chapters 1 - 4 to manipulate the data validation.

[] - Make sure both operands accept negative, positive, and zero as a value.

[] - Only check for divisibility by zero when the division is selected from the menu.

[] - Validate the operator to only accept the listed options on the menu

[] - Do not forget to make sure you use correct grammar in your output.

[] - Make sure you comment.

[] - Observe the order that the operands will be placed

[] - Make sure your code does not crash when run-time errors occur (division by 0 and/or modulo for real numbers) but give informative messages to the user instead.
