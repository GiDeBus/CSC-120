This project is on random numbers, switch statements, loops, functions, and file streams.

 ***************READ CAREFULLY ******************

[x] - Have a function for your project title (banner) with 
  the appropriate information nicely centered on top.

[x] - Nice well-formatted source code.

[x] - Nice well-formatted output screen.

[x] - Display this menu
         1]  Addition only
         2]  Subtraction only
         3]  Multiplication only
         4]  Integer Division only
         5]  Real Division only
         6]  Modulo only
         7]  Addition and subtractions
         8]  Addition, subtraction and multiplication
         9]  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and int division
         10] All operators
         11] End program
[x] - Prompt the user to enter a choice. Validate input.

[-] - Ensure your code doesn't crash when characters are inputted after a double is given 
      for an action to be performed, and the prompts appear when they are supposed to.

[x] - Prompt the user on the number of questions they want to have in the quiz. Validate input.

[] - The program will create the appropriate number of questions to check the user's 
      knowledge in addition/subtraction/multiplication/division/modulo.

[] - The kind of question to be asked is random.

[] - The operands are also random (the operands will be between 1 and 99). 

[] - The operator depending on the menu selection, is random.

[] - Pay attention to the formatting of the questions when asked.
The user needs to type the answer. Validate all  input

[] - He/she has two attempts.

[] - If he/she gets the answer on the second attempt. he/she gets partial credit for the question.

[] - If the second attempt is incorrect the program provides the correct answer.


[] - Clear the screen between the new menu loads. use the system("cls") to clear the screen.( Windows only)
  Feel free to use the to_string() function to convert a value into a string. 

[] - Validate all input. You should keep asking the user for correct input until a valid one is given.

[] - When you finish all the questions, ask the user if they want to run the program again. Validate all input.

[] - If yes, Validate all input and load the menu again.

[] - if No, Exit the program with an appropriate message.

[] - If you select quit from the menu, Exit the program with an appropriate message.

[] - At the end of the quiz (s), provide a report about the user's performance 
    (number of correct answers, number of partially correct
     answers - i.e., second attempt, the total number of questions asked, and the score as a percentage. 

[] - Make sure to store the report on a txt file called Report.txt.
[] - Do not forget to make sure you use correct grammar in your output.

[] - Submit .cpp and report.txt file
