# Group Project: Student Line Up

A teacher asked all her students to line up according to their first names. 
For example, in one class Amy will be at the front of the line and, Yolanda would be at the end.

Write a program that: 

[] - prompts the user to enter the number of students in the class, then 
[] - loops to read that many names and 
[] - save the names to a file called LineUp.txt.

Next, the program should: 
[] - read those names from the LineUp.txt file. 
      Names should be read until there is no more data to read. 
      Once all names have been read, 
[] - it reports which student would be in front of the line and 
[] - which one would be at the end of the line.

- You may assume that no two students have the same name.

[] - Input validation: Do not accept a number less than  1 or greater than 25 for the number of students.

You can use the attached file to test your program.
